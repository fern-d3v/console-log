    <p>Notes and organization of said notes is one of my favorite things in this world. I started using
        <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian.md</a> it was for ttrpg (table-top role playing games, I play a
        bi-weekly game of Dungeons and Dragons with my roommates and our friends, I am also preparing to run a
        new system called Shadowdark RPG) purposes. It changed the game for my note-taking during sessions as
        well as my prep for the upcoming campaign! So I thought why not use it to assist me in learning WebDev?</p><br/>

    <h3>what is obsidian?</h3>
    <p><strong>obsidian.md</strong> is a markdown style text editing software. It comes pretty bare bones, which is
        nice for getting to know the software and how it functions. Luckily there are a bunch of youtubers out there
        who use obsidian, which makes finding answers to questions so much easier! You can do a lot with obsidian,
        below is an image of my "home page" which I use daily to track my WebDev learning.
